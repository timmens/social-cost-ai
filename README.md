## The Social Costs of Artificial Intelligence

### Overview

Artifical intelligence has grown rapidly over the last decades, followed with a growing demand of computing power.
This massive demand of computing power already makes up a significant portion of emissions for certain industries.
In this project we aim to shed light on the energy consumption of artifical intelligence.


## Plan

- Run testing notebook to set up energy consumption measurement
- Train proper algorithm from scratch: BERT
