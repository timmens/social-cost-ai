## The Social Costs of Artificial Intelligence

### Overview

Artifical intelligence has grown rapidly over the last decades, followed with a growing
demand of computing power.  This massive demand of computing power already makes up a
significant portion of emissions for certain industries.  In this project we aim to shed
light on the energy consumption of artifical intelligence.


## Next steps

1. Run testing notebook to set up energy consumption measurement

2. Train BERT from scratch

    - b) https://github.com/NVIDIA/DeepLearningExamples/tree/master/PyTorch/LanguageModeling/BERT
    - c) https://github.com/facebookresearch/XLM#i-monolingual-language-model-pretraining-bert
    - d) https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/zh/latest/nlp/bert_pretraining.html

    - f) https://huggingface.co/blog/how-to-train
    - g) https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert


Link b) seems to be most promising. It is mantained by NVIDIA and provides scripts for
all training steps. It is available for PyTorch and TensorFlow.
