## The Social Costs of Artificial Intelligence

### Overview

Artifical intelligence has grown rapidly over the last decades, followed with a growing
demand of computing power.  This massive demand of computing power already makes up a
significant portion of emissions for certain industries.  In this project we aim to shed
light on the energy consumption of artifical intelligence.


## Next steps

1. Run testing notebook to set up energy consumption measurement

2. Train BERT from scratch using scripts from:
