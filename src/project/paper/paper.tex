\begin{abstract}
    \noindent Modern AI research and its application in industry have developed rapidly
    over the last decades. We claim that the AI community has (implicitly) defined their
    success using a metric which focuses solely on an improvement of model accuracy. In
    this essay, we further argue that by ignoring other social criteria (e.g.
    environmental or economic) the community can drift towards a socially suboptimal
    equilibrium.

\section{Introduction}

There is a small and recent literature tackling questions concerning the social costs of
AI. In the following sections I will review the papers I found to be most similar to
what we want to do. A list of further potentially interesting papers is appended to the
bibliography.


\section{Literature Review}

\subsection{Quantifying the Carbon Emissions of Machine Learning}

\subsection{Green AI}

\subsection{Energy and Policy Considerations for Modern Deep Learning Research}
