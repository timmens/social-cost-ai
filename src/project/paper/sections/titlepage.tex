    \noindent \blue{Abstracts are written last, so don't worry if its not good yet.} AI
    research and its application in the industry have developed rapidly over the last
    decades. We argue that the AI community has (implicitly) defined its success in
    terms of a metric which focuses exclusively on improving model accuracy. In this
    paper, we further argue that by neglecting other social criteria (e.g. environmental
    or economic), the community can drift into a socially suboptimal equilibrium. In
    order to accurately model the trade-offs between social criteria and model
    improvement, one must develop methods to measure the impacts of creating and running
    AI models.
