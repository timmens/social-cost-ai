### Project status (last presentation)

- Build test computing infrastructure <span style="color: green;">&#10004;</span>
    - Setup energy measurement architecture <span style="color: green;">&#10004;</span>
    - Setup computing environment <span style="color: green;">&#10004;</span>
    - Run BERT model <span style="color: orange;">&#9881;</span>
- Build real computing infrastructure <span style="color: red;">&#10060;</span>
    - Get new computing hardware <span style="color: red;">&#10060;</span>
- Analyze energy data <span style="color: red;">&#10060;</span>


---
### Run BERT model

- No proper hardware yet
    - Use existing infrastructure

- No proper software for model training
    - Find software to train BERT base
    - Realize our existing hardware is too old

- Will come back to this task <span style="color: orange;">&#9881;</span>

---
### Build computing infrastructure

- Buy professional hardware system
    - Delivered: 30. March 2022

- Realize there are problems with the system: 4. April 2022
    - Try to fix them, does not work
    - Contact customer support

- Return device: 1. June 2022

---
### Build computing infrastructure (2)

- Return device: 1. June 2022

- Get repaired device back: 4. July 2022
    - Realize its still broken...
    - Contact customer support again

- Return device: 25. August 2022

- Repaired device arrives: 2. September 2022
    - It kinda works! &#x1F389;

---
### Build computing infrastructure (Back-Up Plan)

- Existing hardware was too old
    - Specifically: GPU was too old

- Replace this component: 17. June 2022
    - Works perfectly!

- Build computing infrastructure <span style="color: green;">&#10004;</span>

- Run BERT model <span style="color: green;">&#10004;</span>

---
### Run BERT model training

- Wikipedia
    - $\approx$ 1 billion words and symbols
    - Training time: 1 day
- BookCorpus
    - $\approx$ 11,000 books (read 10 books per month for 100 years)
    - $\approx$ 10 billion words and symbols
    - Training time: 6 days

## What can our AI model do?

**Notebook example**

---
### Energy consumption

- Strubell et al. (2019)
    - 1,500 kwh
    - 2,500 km (driven by average car)
    
- AI Lab
    - 40 kwh
    - 70 km (driven by average car)

# Whats Next?

---
### Lessons Learned

- Always have a back-up plan

- Be less patient in B2B contexts
